# GXtract Overview

GXtract is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to facilitate interaction with knowledge bases, primarily through services like GroundX. It allows users to search, query, and understand complex documents, especially scientific papers and technical literature.

Built on Python 3.12 and FastMCP v2, GXtract prioritizes performance, cross-platform compatibility, and ease of extension.

Key functionalities include:

- Searching for documents based on keywords or semantic similarity.
- Querying specific documents for detailed information.
- Explaining semantic objects like diagrams, tables, or code blocks within documents.
- Managing a local cache of metadata to speed up interactions and reduce external API calls.

This documentation will guide you through installation, configuration, usage, and development of GXtract.
